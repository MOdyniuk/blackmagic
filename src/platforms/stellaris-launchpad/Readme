Blackmagic for the Texas Instruments Stellaris Launchpad Board
==============================================================

This allows the Stellaris Launchpad to be loaded with the BMP
firmware. Currently, UART0 on the LM4F is used, which is connected
to the on-board debugger module that exports it via USB as a CDC ACM
serial device.
